### Project Title

Exploring bikesharing data in 3 cities

### Description

In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote the code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used

chicago.csv , new_york_city.csv , washington.csv
